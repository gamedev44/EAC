## (The Concept)

Encrypt-A-Chat is not a traditional encryption tool; it's a new form of secure communication inspired by the way machines talk. It transforms any text into a unique sequence of DTMF (telephone tones) and frequency-shift keying (modem sounds), creating a distinct audio-visual "signal" for each message.

This signal can be saved, or shared as an encrypted text string. Only another user with the Encrypt-A-Chat app can decode the string back into its original message, complete with the original sounds and visuals.

🎙️ How It Works
Type a Message: Enter any text into the app.

Blast / Decode: The app generates a unique audio signal and a corresponding colored timeline graph.

Share Encrypted: Copy the special encrypted data string. This string looks like gibberish to humans but contains all the information needed to reconstruct the signal.

Decode: Another user pastes your encrypted string into their app to see and hear your original message.

💬 Community & Communication
The primary way to communicate is by sharing these encrypted data strings. We have a dedicated hub for this on GitHub Discussions.

Post your encrypted strings there to chat with the community, share puzzles, or just see what others are creating.

🚀 Features
Real-time Signal Generation: Instantly converts text to a unique audio-visual signal.

Encrypted Sharing: Share messages via a scrambled Base64 string that only the app can parse.

Save & Load: Save individual messages or entire conversations as .json files to your local machine.

Visual Timeline: A colorful, dynamic graph represents the frequency and type of each character's tone.

No Backend Needed: Runs entirely in the browser using the Web Audio API.
