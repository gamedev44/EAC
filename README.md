## (The Concept)

Encrypt‑A‑Chat is not a traditional encryption tool; it's a new form of secure communication inspired by the way machines talk. It transforms any text into a unique sequence of DTMF (telephone tones) and frequency‑shift keying (modem sounds), creating a distinct audio‑visual “signal” for each message.

This signal can be saved or shared as an encrypted text string. Only another user with the Encrypt‑A‑Chat app can decode the string back into its original message, complete with the original sounds and visuals.

### 🎙️ How It Works

1. **Type a Message**
   Enter any text into the app.
2. **Blast / Decode**
   The app generates a unique audio signal and a corresponding colored timeline graph.
3. **Share Encrypted**
   Copy the special encrypted data string. It looks like gibberish to humans but contains all info needed to reconstruct the signal.
4. **Decode**
   Another user pastes your encrypted string into their app to see and hear your original message.

### 💬 Community & Communication

The primary way to communicate is by sharing these encrypted data strings. We have a dedicated hub on GitHub Discussions.

🚀 **Join the Live [Encrypt‑A‑Chat Global Transmission Hub](https://gamedev44.github.io/EAC/)**

Post your encrypted strings there to chat with the community, share puzzles, or just see what others are creating.
